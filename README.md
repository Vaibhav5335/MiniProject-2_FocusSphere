# MiniProject-2_FocusSphere
FocusSphere is a premium Java Spring Boot productivity app. It combines advanced task management, markdown notes, habit tracking, expenses, and a daily schedule into one beautiful interface. With safe local data storage, financial charting, and detailed analytics, it transforms how you organize your life, boosting focus and efficiency daily.

FocusSphere is a premium, all-in-one personal productivity workspace designed to centralize and elevate your digital organization. Built on a robust Spring Boot backend with a stunning, high-performance frontend, it seamlessly combines task management, note-taking, habit tracking, financial planning, and scheduling into a single, immersive interface.

At the heart of the application is the Task Command Center, which goes beyond simple to-do lists by supporting nested subtasks, recurring schedules, priority matrixing, and smart tagging. This is complemented by a distraction-free Note Editor that features real-time auto-saving and markdown support, making it perfect for both quick thoughts and deep drafting.

For personal development, the Habit Tracker uses gamification elements like consistency streaks and confetti celebrations to reinforce positive behaviors. Financial discipline is maintained through the Expense Ledger, which offers detailed spending categorization, budget cap alerts, and interactive doughnut charts for visual analysis. The Daily Timeline binds these elements together, providing a linear, 24-hour view of your scheduled commitments to prevent time crunches.

What truly sets FocusSphere apart is its Integrated Analytics Engine. By aggregating data from every module, it generates comprehensive insights such as a daily "Productivity Score," mood correlation graphs, and focus-hour metrics. This feedback loop empowers users to understand their peak performance times and optimize their routines.

From a technical perspective, the app runs on a secure Java 17 Spring Boot server, ensuring enterprise-grade reliability. The frontend creates a fluid user experience using Tailwind CSS for advanced styling and Vanilla JavaScript for instant state management, free from the bloat of heavy frameworks. All data is persisted locally via browser LocalStorage, guaranteeing 100% data privacy and offline capability, with options to export/import JSON backups. With its sophisticated dark mode, fluid animations ("glassmorphism" design), and holistic approach to productivity, FocusSphere transforms the mundane task of planning into an engaging, premium experience.
